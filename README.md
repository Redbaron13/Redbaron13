- 👋 Hi, I’m @Redbaron13
- 👀 I’m interested in computers, technology, drones and crypto. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding, meditation, the law, how to be more concious and present [living in the moment] and how to live a better life, and to be a better listener. 
-    I'm working to become a lawyer and hopefully a judge one day and maybe a app developer, a writer and an artist!
-    My inspirations are often driven by my inate desire to question the world, the law, understanding how things works, finding solutions to personal problems, finding solutions that just make everybodies life easier, finding new ways to understand the things and people around us. 
-   Some of my other passions besides the LAW are: Programing and writing computer code [as my page will or will not reveal in the future], creating solutions to a variety of problems, often arising from a personal need or curiousity, creating updates to established solutions, finding ways to just make life easier for everyone aroud me. Finding ways to make the world a more just and equitable place, to understand those around me, I strongly believe that curiosities are the foundation for learning and without curiousity the desire to learn disapears and with it so does passion, determination and desires. 
-   In my free time I like to fly UAVs (ie. Drones) and take pictures and videos, I like to be creative and to see how I can utilize technology, knowledge and ingenuity to fully realize my creative goals and ambitions. I also enjoy traveling, litigating personal projects and injustices and to stand up for those that can't or won't, finding more ways to be a better version of myself, and to be a better person to those around me. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on absolutely anything. 
- 📫 How to reach me message me.
